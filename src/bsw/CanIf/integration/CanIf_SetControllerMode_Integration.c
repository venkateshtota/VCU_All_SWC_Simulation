 Function name    : CanIf_SetControllerMode_Integration

 Description      : This service uses to ensure that Can_SetControllerMode request works well across AR versions.
    The main reason is from AR 4.3, Can_SetControllerMode function prototype is changed to used Can_ControllerStateType parameter

    For AR version <= 4.2, this API will:
                - directly route the request to Can Driver
    For AR version > 4.2, this API will:
                - Mapping Transition of Can_StateTransitionType into requestedState of Can_ControllerStateType
                - call the 4.3 AR Can_SetControllerMode API.
